I'm a student majoring in Computer Science and Physics. You might wonder how these two fields are related. Well, they are both about design. Physics sheds light on the intricate design of nature, and Computer Science focuses on the design of artificial systems. An elegant design is like a great piece of artwork, with beauty that is beyond words. 

I also work as a software engineer, simply because computers give the unlimited power to design whatever I like.
