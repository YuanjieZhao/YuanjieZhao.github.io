I'm a student majoring in Computer Science and Physics. You might wonder how are these two fields are related in any way. Well, they are both about design. Physics sheds light on the intricate design of nature, and Computer Science focuses on the design of artificial systems. An elegant design is like a great piece of artwork, with beauty that is beyond words. I also work as a software engineer as computers give me the unlimited power to design whatever I like.
